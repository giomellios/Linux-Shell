# Linux-Shell
A lightweight Linux Shell implementation, supporting global shell variables (means that their scope is even in the possibly declared sub-shells), multiple piping, and of course all the commands supported by linux.

To run it: make all, ./cs345sh
To clear directory from .o files: make clean
